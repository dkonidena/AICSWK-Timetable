#This file allows you to test your schedulers. tt.scheduleChecker will return false if your schedule is not legal.
#It will also print a message displaying the constraint being violated by the schedule. 

#Feel free to change the problem you use to test, the example problems folder contains 8 different problems to test your schedule on.
#You may also use those text files as a template to create your own problems, that can be read in by passing the file name to the
# readRequirements method in line 16. 

#Each task of the course work has a different method that must be filled in. The schedule checker module will
#read in the task number variable of the timetable object, which is set in the schedule creation methods.

#Overall, the only changes that need to be made to this file is commenting and uncommenting the correct method call
#based on which problem you are trying to solve, and changing which problem is loaded in.
