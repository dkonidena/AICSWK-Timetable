	#Using the tutorlist and modulelist, create a timetable of 5 slots for each of the 5 work days of the week.
	#The slots are labelled 1-5, and so when creating the timetable, they can be assigned as such:
	#	timetableObj.addSession("Monday", 1, Smith, CS101, "module")
	#This line will set the session slot '1' on Monday to the module CS101, taught by tutor Smith. 
	#Note here that Smith is a tutor object and CS101 is a module object, they are not strings.
	#The day (1st argument) can be assigned the following values: "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"
	#The slot (2nd argument) can be assigned the following values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in task 1 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in tasks 2 and 3. 
	#Tutor (3rd argument) and module (4th argument) can be assigned any value, but if the tutor or module is not in the original lists, 
	#	your solution will be marked incorrectly. 
	#The final, 5th argument, is the session type. For task 1, all sessions should be "module". For task 2 and 3, you should assign either "module" or "lab" as the session type.
	#Every module needs one "module" and one "lab" session type. 
	
	#moduleList is a list of Module objects. A Module object, 'm' has the following attributes:
	# m.name  - the name of the module
	# m.topics - a list of strings, describing the topics that module covers e.g. ["Robotics", "Databases"]

	#tutorList is a list of Tutor objects. A Tutor object, 't', has the following attributes:
	# t.name - the name of the tutor
	# t.expertise - a list of strings, describing the expertise of the tutor. 

	#For Task 1:
	#Keep in mind that a tutor can only teach a module if the module's topics are a subset of the tutor's expertise. 
	#Furthermore, a tutor can only teach one module a day, and a maximum of two modules over the course of the week.
	#There will always be 25 modules, one for each slot in the week, but the number of tutors will vary.
	#In some problems, modules will cover 2 topics and in others, 3.
	#A tutor will have between 3-8 different expertise fields. 

	#For Task 2 and 3:
	#A tutor can only teach a lab if they have at least one expertise that matches the topics of the lab
	#Tutors can only manage a 'credit' load of 4, where modules are worth 2 and labs are worth 1.
	#A tutor can not teach more than 2 credits per day.

	#You should not use any other methods and/or properties from the classes, these five calls are the only methods you should need. 
	#Furthermore, you should not import anything else beyond what has been imported above. 

	#This method should return a timetable object with a schedule that is legal according to all constraints of task 1.

	#Now, we have introduced lab sessions. Each day now has ten sessions, and there is a lab session as well as a module session.
	#All module and lab sessions must be assigned to a slot, and each module and lab session require a tutor.
	#The tutor does not need to be the same for the module and lab session.
	#A tutor can teach a lab session if their expertise includes at least one topic covered by the module.
	#We are now concerned with 'credits'. A tutor can teach a maximum of 4 credits. Lab sessions are 1 credit, module sessiosn are 2 credits.
	#A tutor cannot teach more than 2 credits a day.

	#It costs £500 to hire a tutor for a single module.
	#If we hire a tutor to teach a 2nd module, it only costs £300. (meaning 2 modules cost £800 compared to £1000)
	#If those two modules are taught on consecutive days, the second module only costs £100. (meaning 2 modules cost £600 compared to £1000)

	#It costs £250 to hire a tutor for a lab session, and then £50 less for each extra lab session (£200, £150 and £100)
	#If a lab occurs on the same day as anything else a tutor teaches, then its cost is halved. 

	#Using this method, return a timetable object that produces a schedule that is close, or equal, to the optimal solution.
	#You are not expected to always find the optimal solution, but you should be as close as possible.
